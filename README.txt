This project is my version of the freeCodeCamp Polygon area calculator project, it creates a class rectangle and various methods such as __str__, set_width, set_height, get_area, get_perimeter, get_diagonal, get_picture, and get_amount_inside, then it creates a new class for Square this class inherits all the methods of the previous one and adds some modification on the __str__, __int__, and set_side methods, for the end it creates a graphic representation of the Rectangle and Square, all user input data is validated to be correct.
